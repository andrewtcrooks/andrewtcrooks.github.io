        <p class="section-intro">We build tools that respect your data and your time. Every DataNova product runs locally on your hardware, keeping sensitive information under your control.

        <h2>Therapize</h2>
        <p class="product-tagline">AI-Powered Clinical Notes for Therapists</p>
        <p class="product-description">Record session audio, transcribe automatically, and generate DAP, SOAP, or BIRP notes ready for billing. Powered by locally-run AI models - your data never leaves your device. Therapize solves the documentation burden that keeps therapists at their desks long after clients leave. Instead of scribbling notes during sessions or reconstructing conversations afterward, you press record and focus on your client. The AI handles the rest - transcription, formatting, and clinical language that meets billing requirements.</p>

        <h2>MotionForge</h2>
        <p class="product-tagline">AI-Powered Legal Document Intelligence</p>
        <p class="product-description">Organize case evidence, draft motions, and prepare trial documents using natural language. Built on Paperless-NGX with Mistral OCR and vector search. Legal work generates mountains of paper - police reports, medical records, discovery documents, prior court filings. MotionForge ingests it all, extracts text with state-of-the-art OCR, and makes everything searchable by meaning, not just keywords. Ask "find all mentions of the defendant's whereabouts on March 15th" and get relevant excerpts across hundreds of documents.</p>
