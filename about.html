            <h3>Andrew T. Crooks</h3>
            <p>Founder of DataNova Consulting LLC</p>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Andrew. I build software products and deploy self-hosted infrastructure for businesses that want to own their tools instead of renting them.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a background in data science and astrophysics, I approach every project with an engineer's mindset: understand the problem deeply, build the simplest solution that works, and make sure it keeps working.
            </p>
            <p>
                DataNova started because I kept seeing the same pattern: businesses paying monthly fees for cloud services they could own outright, or spending hours on manual tasks that should be automated. I decided to do something about it.
            </p>

        <h3>My Approach</h3>
        <p>As a veteran, I bring discipline and clarity to everything I build. I don't believe in over-engineering or unnecessary complexity. If a simple solution works, that's what you get.</p>
        <p>I use the same tools I deploy for clients. Paperless manages my documents. n8n automates my workflows. Uptime Kuma monitors my infrastructure. I'm not selling you something I wouldn't use myself.</p>
