            <h3>Andrew T. Crooks</h3>
            <p>Founder of DataNova Consulting LLC</p>
            <p>
                Hi â€” I'm Andrew, the mind behind DataNova Consulting. I help small businesses and independent professionals cut through the noise using custom-built AI productivity tools and data automation workflows.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a background in data science and astrophysics, I specialize in making complex systems simple â€” turning chaotic data, clunky processes, and overwhelming tasks into streamlined, automated tools you can actually use.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've worked across industries, but the mission stays the same: help real people save time, make smarter decisions, and grow their business without the stress (or subscription fees). Whether you need a smart dashboard, a time-saving workflow, or a custom solution built just for how you work â€” I'm here to build it with you.
            </p>
