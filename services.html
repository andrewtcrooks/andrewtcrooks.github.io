    <h2>Replace Subscription Tools with Self-Hosted Solutions</h2>
    
    <div class="service-intro">
        <p>We help small businesses break free from expensive monthly subscriptions by building custom, self-hosted automation workflows. You only pay a one-time setup fee.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Self-Hosted Workflow Automation</h3>
    <p>All the power of Zapier, Make, or n8n, but without the recurring costs.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Custom Zapier Alternative:</strong> Replace your $20-299/month Zapier plan with a self-hosted solution that performs the same functions at a fraction of the long-term cost.</li>
        <li><strong>API Integrations:</strong> Connect all your business tools and services without paying per-integration fees or hitting usage limits.</li>
        <li><strong>Workflow Migration:</strong> We'll recreate your existing Zapier/Make/n8n workflows in a custom, self-hosted environment you own.</li>
        <li><strong>No Monthly Fees:</strong> Pay once for development and implementation. Then run your automations as long as you want.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Additional Services</h3>
